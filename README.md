#Portfolio Website Project

Noah B Truman

##What is it for?

This project is designed to showcase the front-end skills i've learned so far. I will continue to update the project as my skillset grows. Through this repository, you can see the progress in the project as my skillset grows.

The main goals were to:
- Add Javascript interactivity.
- Implement responsive design.
- Pratice for git version control
- Practice HTML forms.

##Key Features:

- Implementation of javascript to provide interactive sliding menu.

- CSS transitions on menu buttons.

- Implementation of JS icon library.

##Future Features:

In the next iteration i will have added actual portfolio projects to the "Portfolio" page. I would like to add Javascript to randomly sample projects from the portfolio page and display them as either a carousel or static banner on the home page which is reassigned on each refresh.

The contact form currently doesn't submit as there's no backend implementation. Once i've gained that skillset i will make the form fully functioning.
